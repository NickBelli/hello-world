The place where I will store my quick programming functions in various languages

Since I am returning to the computer technology world after 10 years away, I figured using this to store
some of the knowledge I have gained would be a great way to make sure I don't lose it in the long run.

Please feel free to contact me if you wish to use anything in this repository, just so I know what you all like to see!
It will all be pretty basic as I continue to develop good coding practices and standards.
